Plan:

- Address space
- Paging HW
- Xv6 memory layout

Achieve isolation.

### Memory Isolation

Address spaces: Give every application including kernel its own address space.

A process cannot refer to another process's memory.

PM get exhausted, need to swap out some pages to disk.

Where pages are allocated? `kalloc`

### Page Tables (HW)

MMU: Memory Management Unit, translates virtual address to physical address.

MMU has a table.

CPU has a pointer pointing to the page table in the memory with the PA. `Satp` register.
