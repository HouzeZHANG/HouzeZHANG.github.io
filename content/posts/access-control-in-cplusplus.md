### Background

C++ provides programmers with a powerful set of *access control modifiers*, today I'll talk about `private`, `public` and `protected` with three different types of inheritance in C++.

Before I start, I'd like to thank *Antoine JOUGLET* of UTC and his LO21 course for helping me sort out these concepts.
